		<h1>THOR ODINSON</h1>
		<p class="paragraph"><b>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians, 
		a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.
		Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology.<br> 
		Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms.<br>
		When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard
		(more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,
		stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.<br>
		Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, 
		"Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</b></p>
